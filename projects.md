## 🔹 Real-Time Digital Twin of a PVT-Water System

**Context**  
Development of a real-time digital twin for a hybrid photovoltaic–thermal (PVT-water) system installed at the SOLLAB experimental platform (UPJV).

**My Role**
- Thermal modeling of PVT collector, storage tank, radiator, and room
- Implementation in MATLAB/Simulink
- Real-time data integration via ESP32 and Modbus TCP/IP

**Key Features**
- Multi-level digital twin (offline → real-time → closed-loop)
- Sensor-based synchronization
- Real-time monitoring and validation

**Tools**
MATLAB, Simulink, ESP32, Modbus TCP/IP

## 🔹 Energy Community Measurement Architecture (ACCU Project)

**Context**  
Design of a measurement and monitoring framework for a Local Energy Community as part of the European ACCU project.

**My Role**
- Definition of electrical and thermal KPIs
- Measurement architecture design
- Data flow and system interoperability analysis

**Tools**
System architecture design, energy KPIs, documentation
