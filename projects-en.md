## 🔹 Ball Levitation – Nonlinear Control System

Experimental ball levitation system based on ESP32, used for teaching and
testing open-loop and closed-loop control strategies.

## 🔹 Smart Lighting System Based on DALI

Embedded smart lighting control system using the DALI protocol, integrating
sensors and automation scenarios for intelligent buildings.

## 🔹 Ball & Beam System – Embedded Nonlinear Control

Experimental embedded control system regulating the position of a ball on an
inclined beam by adjusting the beam angle using a servomotor.
Control is executed in real time on an ESP32 using multi-sensor measurements.

## 🔹 Multi-node CAN Network and OBD-II Communication

Implementation of a real CAN network based on ESP32, including bidirectional
communication between microcontrollers, remote LED control, and an OBD-II ECU
emulator with data displayed on an F12 dashboard.

## 🔹 PCB Design & Hardware Interfaces

Design and development of custom printed circuit boards for control,
measurement, and hardware interfacing in laboratory environments.

The project includes:
- standalone control boards (motors, electromagnets)
- measurement and signal conditioning boards
- interface shields built around a laboratory ESP32 platform

These PCBs are used as hardware building blocks across multiple experimental
systems (ball levitation, motors, DALI lighting, CAN networks).
